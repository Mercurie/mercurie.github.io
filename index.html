I am definitely lost.</h1>

<p align="center">I need daily medication to prevent me from getting very sick and dying. If I go without my medication for even a day or two, I start to feel very sick. I will lose my desire to eat and start vomiting regularly. Eventually I will start to have lots of diarrhea, often bloody. Stressful situations (like being lost) make my symptoms worse.</p>

<p align="center">That's why I need your help!</p>

<p align="center">Please contact my family ASAP at the phone numbers listed on my collar. You can also email my family at <a href="mailto:ifoundioliver@olivermeds.com">ifoundoliver@olivermeds.com</a> </p>

<p align="center">If you do not reach my family right away, please take me to a vet so they I can make sure I am OK while I wait for them. (Don't worry, my mom will pick up the tab!)</p>

<p align="center">Thank you for helping me get back to my family!<br>  <br>  </p>
